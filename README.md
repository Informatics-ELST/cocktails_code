# cocktails_code

This folder and subfolders contain the code used to run the cocktails_finder code 
in the raw form and structure used when developing the program. The structure was 
changed to create the executable file and minor changes were made to the code to 
allow it to be compiled into an exe with pyinstaller. These changes are commented 
in the changed code, with explaination of why.
